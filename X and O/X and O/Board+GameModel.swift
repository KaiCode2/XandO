        The list of how valuable certain moves are is listed below along with the weight/significans of the move.
        1: Immediate victory possible (Move weight: 10000)
            If there is a pre-existing line of 2 and the next space is availible the AI shall take that move to secure a win.
        2: Block possible opponent victory (Move weight: 1000)
            If opponent is 1 move away from a win AI shall counter to secure its safety.
        3: Expand line segment (Move weight: 25)
            If there is an unobstructed path that can be expanded upon and can in turn lead to a victory the AI shall value that move very highly.
        4: Block opponent line segment (Move weight: 20)
            If opponent has the potential to create valueable line segments the AI shall value a counter move highly.
        5: Winabillity (Move weight: 5N where N = potential wins)
            Certain positions have more ways in which they can form potential wins. The AI shall consider more versatile moves more valuable.
